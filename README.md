# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis it to utilize supervised machine learning to evaluate credit card risk for the LendingClub. In particular we utilized multiple models & oversampling techniques in order to mitigate any potential unbalanced classification problems in the data set. 

## Results

The following are the balanced accuracy, precision, and recall scores for all 6 models utilized. 

### Random Over Sampling 
-	SS 1
### SMOTE Oversampling
-	SS 2
### ClusterCentroids Under sampling 
-	SS 3
### SMOTEENN over and under sampling 
-	SS 4
### Balanced Random Forest Classifier Model 
-	SS 5
### Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Model 
-	SS 6


## Summary
In summary, it appears that most of the 6 models utilized in this analysis struggle with accuracy. It is possible that the models utilized are not suitable for evaluating risk with this data set.  If I were to recommend one model, the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Model or Balanced Random Forest Classifier Model appeared to perform more accurately than the others.
